# ESP32-S3-DeviceKitC-1 Demo

## Overview  

This project demonstrates how to use the ESP32-S3-DeviceKitC-1 to connect to Wi-Fi, generate random sensor values, and send them to a server using HTTP and UDP protocols. The project is divided into two branches to showcase different communication methods:

- `wifi_http_requests`: This branch contains code for sending sensor data to a server using HTTP POST requests.  

- `wifi_udp_requests`: This branch contains code for sending sensor data to a server using UDP.

- `Main Branch`: Contains the project overview and documentation.
